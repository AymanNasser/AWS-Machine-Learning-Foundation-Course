Logging is the process of recording messages to describe events that have occurred while running your software

## Choose the appropriate level for logging
- DEBUG - level you would use for anything that happens in the program.
- ERROR - level to record any error that occurs
- INFO - level to record all actions that are user-driven or system specific, such as regularly scheduled operations
